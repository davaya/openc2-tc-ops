# Maintaining the OpenC2.org Website

This note captures the SOP for approving changes to the
[openc2.org](https://www.openc2.org) website, which exists to
support awareness & adoption of OpenC2. 

 - Privileges to commit changes to the OpenC2.org website (AKA,
   the "write team") are assigned to:
   - the TC Co-Chairs
   - the TC Secretary
   - the website architect[^1]
 - The TC Secretary serves as the Website Editor
 - Website changes are proposed using GitHub pull requests
   directed to the
   [openc2-org.githib.io](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-org.github.io)
   repository. Any TC member can propose website changes.
 - The Website Editor can directly commit **routine / editorial
   changes** (typos, wrong dates, broken links).
 - **Moderate** changes should be reviewed by a second write team
   member before merging:
   - New “OpenC2 in the News” items
     - Exception: publication of documents by OASIS, which can be
       posted w/o a review
   - New / replacement carousel items
   - Items of comparable impact to the above
 - The Working Meeting should approve, at any regular meeting:
   - Any **structural changes** to the site
 - Either TC Co-Chair or the Secretary can approve an “urgent”
   change that would normally go through the working meeting, if
   needed (shouldn't really have any of those).


This SOP was originally agreed to by the Implementation
Considerations Subcommittee in October 2020. With the abolition
of the subcommittees in March 2021, the responsbility for
approving significant website changes was transferred to the
[Working Meeting](Working-Meeting-Process.md) process, and the
text above reflects that change.

provided by AT&T. The architect is not involved in routine
maintenance of the website.
