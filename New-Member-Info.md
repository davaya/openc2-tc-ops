# Secretary's Welcome Message
## Information for new TC members about the OpenC2 TC's operating routine.

Welcome to the OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee (TC). As TC Secretary, I'd like to give you some basics about our TC operations:

* An overview of the TC, including our 
[subcommittees (SCs)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2#subcommittees) and 
[standing rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2#other) can be found at 
[our home page at OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2)

* General information about OpenC2 can be found at [OpenC2.org](https://openc2.org/)

* We conduct TC and SC meetings using [Lucid Meetings](https://www.lucidmeetings.com). 
As the OASIS Kavi system is the system of record for TC activities, you'll receive 
two invitations for any meeting _series_: one from Kavi, one from Lucid. We schedule
our meetings in 6-month blocks, so when we schedule a new block there's a passle of email.
  * Our monthly TC meetings have a daytime (US 11:00 AM Eastern) and evening 
  (US 9:00 PM Eastern) session on the third Wednesday of each month. Attendance 
  at either session (which you should record in Kavi) constitutes attendance 
  for that month's meeting. We treat these two sessions as a single meeting
  for purposes of attendance, meeting minutes, motions voted, etc.
  * If you opt to join any SCs you will then receive invitations for those 
  meetings as well. The current routine SC meeting schedule is as follows:
    * Language SC: 1st Wednesday of the month at 11:00 AM US Easter time
    * Implementation Consideration SC: 1st Tuesday of the month at 11:00 AM US Eastern Time
    * Actuator Profiles SC:  2nd and 4th Wednesdays of the month at 11:00 AM US Eastern Time
  * In OASIS Kavi, all meetings are scheduled on the TC calendar; we don't use the SC calendars
  * The entire meeting schedule will be visible on your 
  Lucid dashboard once you've been added to the OpenC2 "room".
  
  
* TC & SC Communications:
  * In joining our TC youâ€™re automatically subscribed to the TC email list. 
  * If you join any SCs, you'll also be added to that SC's mail list. 
  * We also do much of our communications in our [Slack community](https://openc2-community.slack.com). 
You'll receive an invitation for that as well.

* At present most of our work product development is happening on GitHub, 
and there is also a collection of open repositories there with OpenC2 implementations. 
  * [Work product repos](https://github.com/oasis-tcs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=openc2&type=&language=): specifications and related documents
  * [Open repos](https://github.com/oasis-open?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=openc2-&type=&language=): software contributions

* The TC also has a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0ByY7rMsnC7rrY1JEMlBLckNXTG8) 
where we did much of our work in the past; 
you can find a lot of history and reference information there.

If you joined the TC as an Observer, we welcome your interest and just ask that 
you respect the [limits of that role](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/roles) 
and not try to actively participate in the activities on the resources above.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
