# Working Meeting Process
#### Information for TC members about planning and conducting working meetings.

As explained in the [General Member Information](New-Member-Info.md) document, the TC conducts three working meetings on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Wednesdays of each month at 11:00 am Eastern time. This document describes the norms for planning, conducting, and recording the results of working meetings. Working meetings primarly focus on advancing the TC's work products, which are listed in [this document](Work-Product-List.md).

The agenda for working meetings, generally, is:
 * Introduction
 * Work Product 1 discussion
 * ...
 * Work Product _n_ discussion
 * Other Business
 * Wrap-Up
 
Agendas are coordinated via a combination of 
 1) discussion on the TC mail list where work product editors and the TC co-chairs and secretary can coordinate which work products need discussion time at a particular working meeting, and 
 1) editing of the agenda in Lucid Meetings to capture the plans for a particular discussion. 

All TC members are encouraged to raise other agenda topics as needed. We also have an #Agenda channel in Slack (NOTE: to be created) where anyone interested in meeting planning can chime in. 

An editor for each work product to be discussed will be made the Presenter in Lucid Meetings for the agenda section for their work product to enable the editor to directly edit that portion of the agenda. The template for a work product discussion agenda is:
 * Editors:  editor 1, editor 2
 * Link for the work product GitHub repository
 * Brief status summary: ... (with any relevant links)
 * GitHub issues and/or pull requests (PRs) up for discussion
 * Next steps: what's needed to progress toward Committee Specification (or OASIS Standard)

The outcome of the discussion should be captured primarily using GitHub mechanisms, through updates to issues and PRs. Action items can be captured in Lucid Meetings. Work product editors are also encouraged to send a brief summary of meeting results to the TC mailing list to keep TC members apprised of progress.
